# A Total Unimodularity Based Branch-and-Bound Method for Integer Programming

This repository contains a Java implementation of the algorithm described in the paper
 ["A Total Unimodularity Based Branch-and-Bound Method for Integer Programming"](./docs/paper.pdf) by 
 Jun Wang, Mei Long and Duan Li.
 
 The implementation is for Random 3-SAT and uses the JOptimizer library for solving the relaxation problem 
 used in the branch and bound technique.
